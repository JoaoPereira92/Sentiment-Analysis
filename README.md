# Sentiment-Analysis

This project is to read an Amazon Database of reviews, analyze only the text reviews, and give out a sentiment of 2 reviews and similarities between both.
The user can choose the 2 reviews in question by indexing them from 0 to 4999.

This project consists of 3 files:
Amazon_Product_Reviews.csv - Our database.
Sentiment_analysis_report - This consists of a report on how the program works and the positive and negative aspects of the module used. (spaCY)
Sentiment_analysis.py - Our main program which then reads 2 numbers from the user to index the dataframe and give back the sentiment and similarities between both.
